# Emulate a chat bot using Markov Chain logic
## Emile, a self-improvement chat bot
My friends Charlie Molthrop and Nazli Danis have teamed up to create and run Emile, a chat bot communicating through text to help you set and achieve your daily sleep and fitness goals. Inspired by Emile's upbeat and motivational tone, I sought to emulate Emile's responses through Markov Chain logic, in which responses to previous texts can be used to answer similar messages in the future. With conversations saved as individual Slack channels, Charlie and Nazli were able to share the anonymized logs of previous conversations to allow me to play!

## The Goal
Using the skills and instruction gained from Codecademy's Python Final Project, my goal was to use Python coding and Markov Chain logic to emulate a goal-setting conversation with Emile, allowing users to input goals and achievements at the command line and receive instructions, motivation and applause from Emile in response. The result is a fun log between the end user and Emile: it might not be the most intelligible conversation, but is a fun application of the conversation data and a great jumping off point for more accurately emulating regular conversation. 

## Next Steps
As more conversational data is stored on a daily basis, this program's database will grow both in recognizable inputs and possible responses. The two areas to dive into from here would be... 
  1. looking at historical messages (i.e. not just randomly choosing which possible response to return but looking higher up in the conversation to see what makes the most sense) and ...
  2. employing Natural Language Processing to match similar inputs, rather than exact inputs with reasonable outputs.
